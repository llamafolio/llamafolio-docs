# Balances

The **goal** of `getBalances` is to attach dynamic data to contracts returned previously e.g. `amount` of tokens, underlyings and rewards.

Because aTokens, stable and variable debt tokens are ERC20 contracts, we can use `balanceOf` method to retrieve user balances.

We can then add amount to the contract and the underlying.

```ts title="/src/adapters/aave-v2/ethereum.ts"
import { getERC20BalanceOf } from "@lib/erc20";

async function getLendingPoolBalances(ctx: BalancesContext, contracts: Contract[]) {
  const balances: Balance[] = await getERC20BalanceOf(ctx, contracts as Token[])

  // use the same amount for underlyings
  for (const balance of balances) {
    if (balance.amount > 0n && balance.underlyings) {
      balance.underlyings[0] = { ...balance.underlyings[0], amount: balance.amount }
    }
  }

  return balances
}
```

Important note: For performance reasons

:::info

Only contracts the user interacted with are passed to `getBalances`.

:::

A contract interaction is defined as follow:

- account made a transaction to this contract
- account received this token through event `"Transfer(address,address,uint256)"`

In this example, this means `pools` can be either `undefined` (the user haven't used any of these contracts) or a `subset` of pools.

To help manage `undefined` values and resolve balances, we'll use `resolveBalances` available in `@lib/balance`.
This function maps grouped contracts to a "resolver": a function that takes contracts in and return balances (contracts + amount) out.

```ts title="/src/adapters/aave-v2/ethereum.ts"
import { getERC20BalanceOf } from "@lib/erc20";
import { resolveBalances } from "@lib/balance";

export const getBalances: GetBalancesHandler<typeof getContracts> = async (
  ctx,
  contracts
) => {
  const balances = await resolveBalances<typeof getContracts>(ctx, contracts, {
    pools: getLendingPoolBalances,
  });

  return {
    balances,
  };
};
```
